      <h3>I Hate My Name. - March 17, 1967</h3>
      <body>I can’t stand my name. I wish I was named something else or at least born somewhere else—someplace where my name wouldn’t be made fun of by the other kids. I know that my mother named me after my great-grandmother who was born in the year of the horse, just like I was. Even then, I can’t help but hate my name. Maybe if I had been named something pretty like Sofia, the kids at my school wouldn’t make fun of my name. They call me Ess-ppur-uhn-za or stutter on purpose when saying my name. I guess I’ll just have to wait until I’m older to change my name.</body>

      <h3> - July 23, 1967</h3>
      <body>Today, we got a bag of shoes—real pretty shoes. Me, Rachel, and Lucy tried them on; we tried standing, we tried walking. Rachel shows us the ropes. We stood, we walked, we ran. We walked all along the street, down past Mr. Benny’s old shop where it always smelled like cigar smoke; I could just feel the stares of jealous girls as we walked by. Then a creepy old man started calling out to us, telling Rachel that she is “so pretty with those lemon shoes. Lucy and I grabbed Rachel and ran as fast as our legs would take us and ran all the way back, back to the safety of Mango Street. We hid those shoes, and they’re still hidden. Hidden underneath the bushel basket on the back porch. “We are tired of being beautiful.”</body>
